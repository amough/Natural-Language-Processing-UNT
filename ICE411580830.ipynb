        "Sequence alignment comes in several different flavors or varieties:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Global sequence alignment** assumes two sequences are homologous (or share a common evolutionary ancestor) across their whole length. It tries to line up the whole thing, from tail to snout. This might be a reasonable assumption for two genes in the same gene family, for instance. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Local sequence alignment** assumes that there are regions of homology within a bigger sequence, but also regions that do not share common ancestry. This might be a reasonable assumption if checking how many genes two species share. If the species aren't extremely closely related, we would expect that they would share certain genes, but also that there should be large portions of the genome that do not share detectable evolutionary ancestry between the two species (due to large insertions, deletions, inversions or rearrangements). \n",
        "\n",
        "Alignment methods can also be **pairwise** methods, in which two sequences are aligned or **multiple sequence alignments** in which many sequences are aligned together (e.g. all the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase genes in mammals).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter we will focus first on global alignment. However, once you understand global alignment in detail, the algorithm for local alignment is similar enough that you can understand that as well, with just a little extra effort. \n",
        "\n",
        "In **pairwise global sequence alignment** we begin with two sequences. These can be DNA, RNA or amino acid sequences. For simplicity, let's focus at first on pairwise global alignment of DNA sequences. \n",
        "\n",
        "We'll assume that the full length of our two sequences are homologous, but may contain *insertions* or *deletions* of nucleotides that have caused the homologous positions not to line up with each other. Therefore, our goal is to 'align' or line up these homologous positions in the sequences by adding '-' characters to certain places in each sequence.

Generally, the more common insertions or deletions are biologically, the lower the gap penalty should be. Similarly, the more common substitutions are, the lower the substitution penalty should be.

The second will be our traceback matrix, where we record the set of steps that got us to that optimal score. One trick is that we will have an extra gap ('-') character before each sequence (so the number of rows be one more than the length of sequence 1, and the number of columns will be one more than the length of sequence 2.

We'll improve on it in a moment, but can you see how the row/column labels you would encounter if you go from top left to bottom right in the table correspond to this alignment? If not, it may be worth trying it by hand step-by-step: the first cell you'd enter in the top left would have a G in both the row and the column. That represents the match between the G's in the top and bottom sequence in the alignment above. The next step would have a C in the column but an A in the row. That would represent the mismatch between C and A in the second position of the alignment. Mistmatches like this indicate that during evolution either the ancestor was a C and one sequence had a C --> A substitution in the bottom sequence, or the ancestor was an A and there was an A--> C substitution in the top sequence. \n",

This would indicate that the first G in our first sequence is paired with nothing ('-') in our second sequence. Biologically, this would indicate that the ancestral sequence either had a G and it was lost in the bottom sequence (a deletion) or that the G was added by mutation into the top sequence (an insertion). Now move your finger down and to the right. The next cell you encounter is no longer a pairing of G with G (as before) but now a pairing of the first G in the bottom sequence with the C in position 2 of the top sequence. Effectively, all our other pairings will be 'offset' by 1 due to the insertion in the left sequence.  This will change which positions look like matches vs. mismatches.

        "\n",
        "Before we try to write actual alignment code, let's make sure we're comfortable iterating over the cells of our array. Basically this means setting up code that lets us visit each cell in the array one by one - like running our finger along a table to read each row one by one from top to bottom. \n",
        "\n",
        "To visit a cell in the table, we need it's *index*, which is the row and column number for that cell. So to visit all the cells, our main challenge is to generate each row and column number one by one. To do this we will set up an outer `for` loop that iterates over each row one by one, setting each row number to a variable (here I call this variable `row_index`, but `i` is most commonly used in real code). Within each loop over the row numbers, an inner `for` loop iterates over each column number one by one and sets its value to a variable (here I use `col_index`, but `j` is most typically used in real code). Inside both loops, we will have a value for the current row and column number. We can use these to index into the scoring array using array indexing (`scoring_array[row_index,column_index]`). \n",
        "\n",
        "In the short code snippet below, let's practice this setup, and use it to number each cell of the array by the order in which we visit it. This can help show us visually what order our code is visiting the cells of our array."

For example, transitions within purine (A or G) or pyrimidine (C or T) nucleotides tend to be much more common than transversions that cross these classes (e.g. A --> T or G --> C).
